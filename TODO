better warnings based on r_ai_ss

output summary tex file showing question and student performance
- mean, mode, std, N_exams, N_students
- histogram of student total points P_s
- histogram of points for each question (normalized by max points?) Pbar_Q
- for each question:
  - histogram showing answer choices (mark correct one somehow) R^a_QVA = n^a_QVA / n^s_QV
  - variant ratios R_QV (not needed? can see from R^a_QVA?)
- correlation between questions

check that answers are distinct
also check that question variants are distinct?

More stats to report: m_{QVA}(q,v,a) = average score of all students
answering $a$ for variant $v$ of question $q$. ?  Could also report
m_{QVB}(q,v,b) = average score of all students getting question $q$,
variant $v$ correct (if b=1) or incorrect (if b=0).

Fix reporting with r_ai_ss.

Integrate bad-key error reporting (closest Hamming match, best score match).

For each question, plot average score of students in each quintile.
