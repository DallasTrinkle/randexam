output summary tex file showing question and student performance
- mean, mode, std, N_exams, N_students
- histogram of student total points P_s
- histogram of points for each question (normalized by max points?) Pbar_Q
- for each question:
  - histogram showing answer choices (mark correct one somehow) R^a_QVA = n^a_QVA / n^s_QV
  - variant ratios R_QV (not needed? can see from R^a_QVA?)
- correlation between questions

check that answers are distinct
also check that question variants are distinct?
