\section{Recommended procedures}

To prepare a ``Final'' exam, we assume that we are working within a
\texttt{exam_final} directory.

\subsection{Preparing the exams}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make a directory called \texttt{1_exams} and copy in
  \texttt{randexam} and \texttt{library.tex}.
\item Rename \texttt{library.tex} to \texttt{final_library.tex} and
  set the \texttt{PREFIX} in \texttt{randexam} to \texttt{final_}.
\item Edit \texttt{final_library.tex} to add questions and make the
  coversheet.
\item Run \texttt{./randexam proc-lib}.
\item Run \texttt{pdflatex final_exams.tex}, and look at the output
  near the end for information about exam lengths.
\item Adjust \texttt{MINIMUM_EXAM_PAGES} in \texttt{randexam} to be
  the smallest even number that is at least as large as the maximum
  raw length.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Administering the exams}

\begin{itemize}
\item Collect both the Scantron sheets and the exam papers (with names
  on them) from the students, so that exam papers can be later matched
  to students if needed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Grading the exams}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make a subdirectory called \texttt{2_scantrons} containing a raw
  unedited copy of the Scantron data files.
\item Make a subdirectory called \texttt{3_grading} and copy in the
  contents of both \texttt{1_exams} and \texttt{2_scantrons}. All
  editing should be done in this third directory.
\item Run \texttt{./randexam proc-scan} and clean up errors in the
  file as needed.
\item Run \texttt{./randexam proc-ans}.
\item If desired, run \texttt{./randexam proc-curve} and adjust the
  \texttt{curve_scores()} function in \texttt{randexam} as desired.
\item Upload \texttt{gradebook.csv} to record the total scores.
\item Run \texttt{./randexam proc-feedback}.
\item If desired, create a \verb+rawscan+ directory with PDFs of
  individual Scantron sheets to be included in email feedback.
\item Run \texttt{./randexam proc-email}.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
